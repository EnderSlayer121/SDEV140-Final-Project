So far, I have managed to set up a main area where you can type each of the total stocks of each clothing item. I was additionally going to try to get it to show the total price of the stock based on how much stock is there as well, but I've been running into issues with it and am unable to get it to properly calculate at the moment. After I'm able to get this part done, I will start to work on displaying the total price of all of the items as well as finding out how to use multiple windows.
